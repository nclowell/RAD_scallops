This makes me think that it's not parameter 21, although just to be doubly sure, I'm going to make cragig011 and set the value to 4 as it was in cragig004. And, I got the same error message again. It's not that parameter. I'm now going to compare the stats output files from the test run (cragig004) and cragig009 to see which step before Step 7 could have caused this issue."

I'm curious about what will happen if I remove the population assignment file, and set the min samples locus param21 to 5 (has to be in half the scallops, doesn't matter what population). This will be **cragig015**. That worked, and produced 4773 loci per sample. What about if I lower param21 to 3? Does it affect retained loci predictably? Will do in **cragig016**. Not really - the number of retained loci was almost identical, at 4770 loci per sample.\n",

I'm not sure if excluding samples is just a matter of moving fastq files, or if ipyrad calls individuals using the barcodes file or the population assignment file. So trying the fastq file removal idea first. Ugh, same error. Let me see in the stats file if it at least excluded FG100_A. Doesn't look like it got removed.\n",

Gonna look at the stats out file from step 7 to see whether there were 143 samples in the run (as in, did removing the consens files for FG100A actually remove it from the assembly). Ah! Still 143 samples, so it didn't actually remove FG100A.\n",

Sweet! That worked. Now I have **cragig021** as the merged assembly. Going to go in and make the rest of the parameters just like **cragig004** (which worked) aka set param13 to 2000, param17 to 35.

That makes me think that it's using the population assignment file in step 7 to call samples, but there are no files named FG102_A so it's confused. Going to try deleting the population assignment file out of **cragig008** and rerunning step 7 of **cragig021**. Crap. That didn't solve the problem either. Then I tried using the subdata branching thing, where I can specify a list of samples to use in a branch, and I excluded any reps (with As and Bs), and I still got the same error about FG102_A! \n",
